# discourse-display-first-name-only

See https://meta.discourse.org/t/restrict-username-to-user-first-name/297604.

On the New Account modal, it hides the username field and automatically generates its value based on the name value (extracting only the first name). Also, because discourse automatically appends a number to keep the username unique, the username displayed is formatted to remove this number.
